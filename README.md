# Rostock AC Heated Bed Firmware
Repetier firmware for all RAMBo controlled SeeMeCNC 3D Printers. One firmware, configuarable for all RAMBo deltas. 

This firmware is based off of Repetier Firmware, through many years and versions, as well as some integration with features of marlin and others work.

## What makes this firmware different?

This firmware is configured for printers using a heated bed controlled by a Solid State Relay (SSR). It uses dead-time control and was tuned for a Keenovo 110V 500w AC Heat Pad. Apart from this configuration it is 100% identical to the stock Repeiter firmware written by SeeMeCNC. You may need to determine your own dead time parameters if you are using a different heat pad.
